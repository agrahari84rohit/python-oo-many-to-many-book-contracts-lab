# Many-to-many Object Relationships Lab

This project models a many-to-many relationship between books and authors using a Contract class as the join model. It demonstrates how one author can work on many books and how one book can have many authors, while also tracking royalty information and contract dates.

## What This Project Does

- Creates Book and Author objects
- Uses Contract as the middle model for the many-to-many relationship
- Lets authors sign contracts for books
- Tracks royalties and contract dates
- Provides quick access to related books, authors, and contract history

## Completed Work

The many-to-many relationship logic is implemented and verified in the current project setup.

Now that we have learned about several types of relationships it's time to build 
one of our own. In this lab you will be creating a many-to many relationship in 
python 

## The Scenario 

We are tasked with building a model to aid in building contracts for books with 
multiple authors. As a part of this model we need to create an Author model, a Book 
model and a Contract model. Authors can have many books through contracts, and books 
can have many authors through contacts.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Define the Problem

Build a model a many to many relationship between Books and Authors:

* Build Book class
* Build Author class
* Build Contract class
* Build connecting methods between all

### Task 2: Determine the Design

#### Book:
* Attributes:
  * title (string)
  * all (array) 
* Methods:
  * contracts()
  * authors()

#### Authors:
* Attributes:
  * name (string)
  * all (array)
* Methods:
  * contracts()
  * books()
  * sign_contracts(book,date,royalties)
  * total_royalties()

#### Contracts:
* Attributes:
  * author (Author class), 
  * book (Book class), 
  * date (string), 
  * royalties (integer)
  * all (array)
* Methods:
  * contracts_by_date()

### Task 3: Develop, Test, and Refine the Code

#### Step 1: Create feature branch

#### Step 2: Create Book class

* `__init__`: title
* Class attributes- all
* Methods:
  * contracts()- This method should return a list of related contracts
  * authors()- This method should return a list of related authors using the Contract class as an intermediary

#### Step 3: Authors

* `__init__`: name (string)
* Class attributes- all
* Methods:
  * contracts()- This method should return a list of related contracts
  * books()- This method should return a list of related books using the Contract class as an intermediary
  * sign_contracts(book,date,royalties)- This method should create and return a new Contract object between the author and the specified book with the specified date and royalties
  * total_royalties()- This method should return the total amount of royalties that the author has earned from all of their contracts

#### Step 4: Contracts

* `__init__`:
  * author
  * book
  * date 
  * royalties 
* Class attributes: all
* Properties: All properties should raise an exception if not valid
  * author: Is an instance of Author class
  * book:  Is an instance of Book class
  * date: Is an instance of a str
  * royalties:  Is an instance of an int
* Class Methods: contracts_by_date()- This method should return all contracts that have the same date as the date passed into the method

#### Step 6: Push feature branch and open a PR on GitHub

#### Step 7: Merge to main

### Task 4: Document and Maintain

Best Practice documentation steps:
* Add comments to the code to explain purpose and logic, clarifying intent and functionality of your code to other developers.
* Update README text to reflect the functionality of the application following https://makeareadme.com. 
  * Add screenshot of completed work included in Markdown in README.
* Delete any stale branches on GitHub
* Remove unnecessary/commented out code
* If needed, update git ignore to remove sensitive data

## Important Submission Note

Before you submit your solution, you need to save your progress with git.

* Add your changes to the staging area by executing git add .
* Create a commit by executing git commit -m "Your commit message"
* Push your commits to GitHub by executing git push origin main
